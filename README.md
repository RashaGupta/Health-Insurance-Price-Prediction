This project is for predicting the prices of health insurance based on various lifestyle factors that customers have.
The dataset is included in the repo. 
The project consists of elaborate EDA and predictive models, with comments and more included.
It was created using Google Colab, but can also be handled by Jupyter Notebook and other IDEs.

Many thanks, Rachana
